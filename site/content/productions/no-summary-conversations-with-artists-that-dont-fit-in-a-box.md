          **Jamil Khoury**, and **Torange Yeghiazarian**, the founders of
          ***Middle East America: A National New Plays Initiative (MEA)***. They
          will discuss the program’s lasting impact and the future of Middle
          Eastern American theatre. Launched in 2008 by The Lark, Silk Road
          Rising, and Golden Thread, the program supported the development and
          production of new work such as *Night Over Erzinga* by Adreana Sevahn
          Nichols, and *We Swim We Talk We Got to War* by Mona Mansour. Golden
          Thread’s **Nora El Samahy** will facilitate."

        text: "*NO SUMMARY* launches with a conversation with **Naghmeh Samini**,
          playwright of *The Language of Wild Berries,* which will be released
          as a radio play on October 6th. One of Iran’s leading playwrights,
          Samini’s work has been presented across Europe and Asia but she has
          never been produced in the US in English. At a time when US-Iran
          relations are at an all-time low, hearing directly from artists that
          create in both countries has never been more vital. The cast and
          creative team from the radio play will join the conversation."

          Hamami**, **Hannah Khalil**, and **Mona Mansour**. We recently

          collaboration model to co-write a new play, and Hamami will write a
          play exploring the Black Panthers’ residency in Algeria in the 1960s
          and 70s.
