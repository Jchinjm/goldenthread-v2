heading: The Case of Animals versus Man
description: >-
  Once upon a time, storm winds cast a ship of diverse nations on the shore of
  an island inhabited by animals living in peace and harmony. The men hunted the
  animals convinced they held dominion over them. The animals took their
  grievance to the wise King of the Jinn who must now preside over The Case of
  Animals versus Man.\

  \

  Drawing from theatre traditions East & West including Commedia dell arte, vaudeville, Khayal (the art of shadow puppetry evolved at Muslim court entertainments), and featuring world music, *Island of Animals* promises to be an entertaining performance of cross-cultural dimensions. The writing emulates the famous Sanskrit tales of Bidpai, Kalila wa Dimna and anticipates Attar’s Conference of the Birds by at least one hundred years; the Ikhwan al-Safa’s *Island of Animals* is an enlightening discovery of classical Muslim literature.
