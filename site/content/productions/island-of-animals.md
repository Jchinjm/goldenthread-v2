  Once upon a time, storm winds cast a ship of diverse nations on the shore of
  an island inhabited by animals living in peace and harmony. The men hunted the
  animals convinced they held dominion over them. The animals took their
  grievance to the wise King of the Jinn who must now preside over The Case of
  Animals versus Man.\

  \

  Drawing from theatre traditions east & west including Commedia dell arte, vaudeville, Khayal (the art of shadow puppetry evolved at Muslim court entertainments), and featuring world music, Island of Animals promises to be an entertaining performance of cross-cultural dimensions. The writing emulates the famous Sanskrit tales of Bidpai, Kalila wa Dimna and anticipates Attar’s Conference of the Birds by at least one hundred years; the Ikhwan al-Safa’s *Island of Animals* is an enlightening discovery of classical Muslim literature.

        tenth century formed a society (Brethren of Purity) and composed the
        Rasa’il, an encyclopaedia of mathematics, physics, geology, ecology,

        Hafiz Karmali served an apprenticeship at the American Repertory Theatre
        at Harvard University where he had the good fortune of assisting
        internationally renowned directors, Andrei Serban & Robert Wilson.\

        Mr. Karmali has a special interest in cross-cultural performances with a view to showcasing indigenous performing arts of the Islamic world. To this end, he has directed *Azaan*– a court entertainment in collaboration with performers from Ismaili communities in London and Tajikistan (Guest of Honour: His Highness the Aga Khan);*Rumi x 7*–*Tales from the Mathnavi* sponsored by the EEC with an acting company in Uzbekistan;*Water for Life*, AKF London, in collaboration with a dance company from Gujarat (Guest of Honour: Princess Zahra Aga Khan); and with folk artists of Karimabad, Hunza,*Legend of the Baltit Fort*– a dance-theatre programme sponsored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), hosted by His Highness and Prince Amyn.\

Hafiz served as a Relief Officer for Focus Humanitarian Assistance (affiliated with the AKDN) as a member of the pioneering team that implemented Project Afghanistan in Kabul, Pul-i-Khumri & Badakhshan (October 1996 – June 1997 during the Taliban regime). Hafiz also served as a member of the organising team for His Highness the Aga Khan’s visits to Tajikistan (May 1995) & Afghanistan (Sept. 1998). A recipient of an AKF International Scholarship, Hafiz spent one year conducting research in Iran and is currently based in Paris where at Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (Sorbonne) he is finalising his doctorate thesis on classical Ismaili philosophy.

    groundbreaking contemporary works that combine dance, music and poetry of
    Central Asia. Founded in 1986 by Choreographer-Director Sharlyn Sawyer, the
