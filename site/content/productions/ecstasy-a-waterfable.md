  What happens when water changes?
description: Golden Thread Productions is proud to present the world premiere of
  **Ecstasy | a waterfable**, a new play commissioned to Bay Area theatre artist
  Denmo Ibrahim and directed by Evren Odcikin. In **Ecstasy**, stories are
  written in water, spells are cast through washing, and to drink either creates
  your life or rips it from you. In this dangerous water world, three uniquely
  lost characters struggle to remember and pray to forget. A man devotes his
  life’s work to a tragically simple task. A young woman is haunted by past
  images not her own. And an elder, submerged in a flood of old pictures, fights
  to remember a story that slowly seduces her into it. Inspired by 9th century
  Sufi fable, "When the Waters Were Changed" and created through a year-long
  development process with the Water Project ensemble with the generous support
  of the prestigious New Works Fund Grant, Zellerbach, and Wallace Gerbode
  Foundation, **Ecstasy | a waterfable** is visceral, physical storytelling at
  its best.

The ancient Sufi story "When the Waters Were Changed", the inspiration for **Ecstasy**, recounts a time when Khidr, the teacher of Moses, warned that all water that had not been specially hoarded would disappear. It would be renewed with different water, which would drive men mad. On the appointed date, the world dried up. There was a period of waiting. And when the waters came again, only one man heeded the call, only one remembered the warning. In **Ecstasy**, the essence of his struggle bleeds through three times of existence –the ancient, the mythic, and the modern.

Weaving elements of text, live music, and ensemble imagery,**Ecstasy** culminates in an interactive ritual of remembering and forgetting. In an attempt to address omens – personal, communal, and global – this visually stunning, non-linear waterfable unravels through an intensely collaborative, highly stylized performance where three divided worlds discover they are bound irrevocably through lineage.
