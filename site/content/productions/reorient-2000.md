          A cartoonish parody of the Adam & Eve tale or did somebody say
          *Iranian Angles in America?* Not!


          Born to an aristocratic family in 1903 in Iran, **Sadegh Hedayat** was among those distinguished students sent to Europe by Reza Shah to earn an education with the expectation that they would facilitate the nation's progress towards modernization. Soon after his return Hedayat co-instituted the Rab'a (The Foursome) a group consisting of young returnees whose progressive ideas antagonized both the literati and the government. In 1936 the Rab'a was outlawed and Hedayat left for India. Hedayat's popularity outside Iran is due mostly to his short novel *The Blind Owl* (1937) which has been translated into numerous languages. Among his other published works are *Buried* *Alive* (1930), *Three Drops of Blood* (1932) and *Haji Aqa* (1945). In the majority of his works Hedayat is extremely critical of religion in general and the Moslem clergy in particular. He also looks down at the foreign powers involvement in Iran as well as the corruption that is rampant among the local government rank and file. The English text of *Myth of Creation* is translated by M.R. Ghanoonparvar and is based on the only version of the original Persian available (Paris 1946). This limited edition of 105 copies indicates that it was not for sale. Hedayat committed suicide in 1951, in Paris. (*The Pearl Cannon* \[Iraj Bashiri] and *The Myth of Creation* \[M.R. Ghanoonparvar] Mazda Publishers)

          An answering machine awaits. In this laconic study of loneliness, the
          color of exile is rendered *red.*


          Since migrating to United Kingdom from his native Iran in 1994 where he was banned from publication **Ghazi Rabihavi** has written several plays as well as short stories and novels. Among his published works are *The Iranian Four Seasons*, *Merriam's Smile*, *David* and *White Stone*. Harold Pinter introduced Ghazi to the British public by producing his play *Look Europe!* In 1997 which he called "A work of a gifted writer." A great source of inspiration and support, Pinter later wrote about the play *Stoning. "*A very strong and powerful piece of work, beautifully constructed." Ghazi is currently directing and producing four of his short plays with the support of the Queensland Multi-Media Art Center in London slated to open in late June of this year.
