    - name: Tom Coash
      credit: Playwright/Director
      bio: "**Tom Coash** is currently living in Haverhill, MA where he founded the
        Neworks Theatre whose mission is to produce new multicultural and/or
        internationally themed plays. Coash spent the last four years teaching
        playwriting at The American University in Cairo and had several plays
        produced there including his recent play *Censory Perceptions* also
        produced at an international festival in Beirut, and *KHAMASSEEN*
        produced at the Edinburgh Theatre Fringe Festival. In 1994/95 Coash was

        Minneapolis. Tom has worked professionally for several theatres
        including Actors Theatre of Louisville and won several awards including
        the Kennedy Center's Lorraine Hansberry Award, the Robert H. Lehan Award
        in 1999. Tom was named the Outstanding Playwright of the Pittsburgh New
        Works Festival."
    - name: Ghazi Rabihavi
      bio: Since migrating to United Kingdom from his native Iran in 1994 where he was
        banned from publication, **Ghazi Rabihavi** has written several plays as
        well as short stories and novels. Among his published works are *The
        Iranian Four Seasons*, *Merriam's Smile*, *David* and *White Stone*.
        Harold Pinter introduced Ghazi to the British public by producing his
        play *Look Europe!* In 1997 which he called "...a work of a gifted
        writer." A great source of inspiration and support, Pinter later wrote
        about the play *Stoning,* "...*a* very strong and powerful piece of
        work, beautifully constructed." Ghazi is currently directing and
        producing four of his short plays with the support of the Queensland
        Multi-Media Art Center in London slated to open in late June of this
        year.
    - name: Sadegh Hedayat
      bio: Born to an aristocratic family in 1903 in Iran, **Sadegh Hedayat** was
        among those distinguished students sent to Europe by Reza Shah to earn
        an education with the expectation that they would facilitate the
        nation's progress towards modernization. Soon after his return Hedayat
        co-instituted the Rab'a (The Foursome) a group consisting of young
        returnees whose progressive ideas antagonized both the literati and the
        government. In 1936 the Rab'a was outlawed and Hedayat left for India.
        Hedayat's popularity outside Iran is due mostly to his short novel *The
        Blind Owl* (1937) which has been translated into numerous languages.
        Among his other published works are *Buried* *Alive* (1930), *Three
        Drops of Blood* (1932) and *Haji Aqa* (1945). In the majority of his
        works Hedayat is extremely critical of religion in general and the
        Moslem clergy in particular. He also looks down at the foreign powers'
        involvement in Iran as well as the corruption that is rampant among the
        local government rank and file. The English text of *Myth of Creation*
        is translated by M.R. Ghanoonparvar and is based on the only version of
        the original Persian available (Paris 1946). This limited edition of 105
        copies indicates that it was not for sale. Hedayat committed suicide in
        1951, in Paris. (*The Pearl Cannon* \[Iraj Bashiri] and *The Myth of
        Creation* \[M.R. Ghanoonparvar] Mazda Publishers).

        (David Hare), *The Road to Mecca (*Fugard), *Six Degrees of Separation*
        (Guare), *Three Cuckolds* (Comedia) and *The Maids* (Genet). His
        production of *Today a Little Extra* at the One Act Theatre was named
        one of the three best of its season by the San Francisco Examiner. Gelb
        directed his own translation of *The Misanthrope* and was one of a group
        responsible for the R.G.Davis/Samuel French version of Dario Fo's *We
        Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!* He has directed and/or written for television,
        multimedia and documentary film. His media work has been seen on PBS,
        KTVU, TV 20, KQED and at the Brussels World Conference on the
        Environment and New York's Museum of Modern Art. Hal has been the West
