Khaled, an Arab-American writer, is eager to cooperate with the two Homeland Security agents who visit him in the aftermath of September 11. What begins as a routine check quickly evolves into an uncomfortable interrogation as the two agents begin to assert their power.  At the center of their suspicion is Khaled's involvement with the mysterious Asfoor, presumably one of the terrorists who is now dead.  One by one, a library clerk, a stripper, and Khaled's ex-girlfriend testify to Khaled's acquaintance with Asfoor and possible involvement in terrorist activities.
