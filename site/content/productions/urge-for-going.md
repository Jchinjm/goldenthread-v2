Fresh out of a residency at Ground Floor at Berkeley Rep, Playwright **Mona Mansour** says: “I’m excited to look again at this piece that really is fairly autobiographical and very close to my heart…I don’t think stories about the Middle East are being told enough, and they surely aren’t being told truthfully.”

Director **Evren Odcikin** adds: “Mona mixes the personal with the political, the funny with the tragic with such craft. Mona is an actor’s writer through and through. I cannot wait to dive into the world she’s created with the amazing cast of actors we’ve assembled.”
