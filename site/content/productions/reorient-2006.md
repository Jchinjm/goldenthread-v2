      - subtitle: by Tawfiq al Hakim, directed by Hal Gelb
        text: In this biting comedy by the acclaimed founder of modern Egyptian theatre,
          a man impersonates a donkey in order to secure a job. Tewfiq al
          Hakim’s signature political satire and social commentary will resonate
          deeply with today’s American audiences.

        title: The Donkey Market
      - subtitle: by Elizabeth Benedict, directed by Arlene Hood
        text: >-
          A man of Turkish descent finds himself in prison and to make his way
          out he must decide if his allegiance lies with his heritage or his
          government. Orhan is a piercing exploration of racial identity in our
          modern society.


          **Elizabeth Benedict**'s play *Jesus in Las Vegas* was recently included in the Z Magic Mondays series of new work. She was included in the 2005 Bay Area Playwrights Foundation Festival and was a finalist in the Festival's BASH event in 2004. Her play, *Surfing Toasters* was performed at the SF Fringe Festival in 2002. She is also an actress.

        title: Orhan
      - subtitle: by Martin Russell, directed by Torange Yeghiazarian
        text: In 2004, there were reports that an Iraqi wedding party was massacred by
          the American army. Army officials assert they raided a meeting of
          terrorists and refuse to take responsibility for the rumored civilian
          deaths. This hard-hitting docudrama shows us the events and aftermath
          of that fatal day.

        title: The Weddings at Mukaradeeb
      - subtitle: by Laura Shamas, directed by Jayne Wenger
        text: >-
          This funny and touching play boils down the issues of government
          surveillance, censorship and freedom of speech to one simple question:
          What would you do if you received an unexpected bag of red pistachios
          from Syria?


          **Laura Shamas**' plays have been developed by many theaters, including Williamstown Theatre Festival, The Old Globe, The Geva Theater, The Utah Shakespearean Festival, and produced by Philadelphia Theater Company, Denver Center Theater Company, Walnut Street Theater, West Coast Ensemble and The Glines/New York, among others. She has nine published plays. Shamas and playwright Jon Klein have just been awarded a 2006-2007 Aurand Harris Fellowship from the Children's Theatre Foundation of America to write a new holiday play together.

        title: Pistachio Stories
      - subtitle: by Adania Shibli, directed by Evren Odcikin
        text: >-
          Four friends living in peaceful harmony find a radio that plays their
          favorite song. But everything is up for grabs once the radio incites
          them to draw their borders and fight to protect their land. This
          absurdist comedy critiques the politics of peace in the Middle East.


          **Adania Shibli**, born in Palestine in 1974, made her main studies in the field of journalism and communication. She has been publishing regularly in literary magazines in the Arab world and in Europe. Her novels have been published in Arabic by Al-Adab Publishing House (Beirut) and in French by Actes-Sud. Shibli twice has been given the Young Writer’s Award-Palestine by the Al-Qattan Foundation. *The Error* is her first play.
