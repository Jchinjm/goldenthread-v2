heading: A timeless tale of a 9th century trailblazer!
description: "Meet Ziryab, the 9th-century musician and cultural icon, in this
  family-friendly new play with live music: a musical genius, a star of the
  Baghdad court, and a fashion innovator. ***The Fifth String*** playfully tells
  the story of his beginnings in Iraq, his life as an immigrant to Cordoba, and
  his lasting contributions in music, fashion, and culture that continue to
  reverberate today. Widely credited with adding a fifth string to the oud and
  with introducing Persian and Arabic influences to Spanish music, his life
  becomes an inspiration for this modern retelling as a story-within-a-story in
  the tradition of *1001 Nights*. Written and directed by Torange Yeghiazarian,
  ***The Fifth String*** is multifaceted performance created collaboratively
  with an ensemble of actors, clowns, and musicians. Part of Golden Thread’s
  Islam 101 initiative, the play features original music composed by Faraz
  Minooei and production design by Mokhtar Paki."

    - name: Faraz Minooei
      bio: "**Faraz Minooei** was born in Tehran and began playing santur at the young
        age of nine. While studying with Behnam Mehrabi, he discovered a deep
        spiritual desire to study music, seeing music as an “unexplainable
        souvenir from the eternal truth”. Faraz received his B.A. from San
        Francisco State University in 2008 as a Nagle Scholar and the first
        World/Jazz music major with santur as his primary instrument! As a
        full-time musician, Faraz is a performer, composer, ethno-musicologist
        and teacher. He views studying music as a never-ending mission. In view
        of that, he has also had the good fortune to study with masters such as
        M. R. Lotfi, H. Omoumi, Royal Hartigan, Hafez Modirzadeh, Michael
        Dessen, Kojiro Umezaki and Christopher Dobrian. Since 2006, he has
        lectured and performed at many universities including SFSU, UCI, UCLA,
        UCSC Stanford University and at the Society of Ethnomusicology. He has
        performed with noted ensembles in the United States, among which was his
        collaboration in 2009 with Yo Yo Ma and Kayhan Kalhor in the Silk Road
        Ensemble (for the 50th anniversary of the Lincoln Center) and the
        collaboration as a composer and santur player with the film director
        Bahram Beyzaie for the play “Jana & Baladour”. Recipient of numerous
        scholarships and grants, he earned his Masters of Fine Arts degree in
        music with emphasis in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and
        Technology from the University of California in Irvine. His thesis,
        “Abstracting” Iranian Classical Music, challenges the traditional
        practice of Iranian Classical Music to introduce innovative and
        transformative functions of the music in contemporary society."

        range from Turkey and Greece into the Arab lands, Iran and India. Gari’s

        his musical career with fiddle and mandolin, and had devoted a decade of
        his life to the violin before learning of his ancestral Hungarian name,
        Hegedus, meaning “violinist.” As a composer and performer, Gari has
        developed the art of taksim (improvisation) to a deeply soulful level
        for which he has become highly recognized."

Golden Thread's Islam 101 initiative was launched in 2011 in response to the rising anti-Islamic sentiments in the US. By creating dynamic and entertaining plays insipired by Islamic art and philosophy, Islam 101 aims to shift the dominant negative stereotypes of Islam and provide Muslim families with a cultural experience they can share and take pride in.  

Launched in partnership with the Islamic Cultural center of Northern California, Islam 101 previously premiered *Rumi X 7 = Tales from the Masnavi* by Hafiz Karmali.
