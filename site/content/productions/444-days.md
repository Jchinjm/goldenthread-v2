  political intrigue? Laleh, an Iranian revolutionary, and Harry, a diplomatic
  attaché, meet for the first time in 25 years as Laleh’s daughter lies in a
  coma. The last time they spoke was when she held him hostage for 444 days at
  the U.S. Embassy in Tehran along with 52 other Americans. International

**Torange Yeghiazarian**’s first production of a full-length play since 1998, *444 Days* is the first play about the Iran Hostage crisis from an Iranian artist’s perspective. Blending historical events with fictional characters, this world premiere play follows the inexplicable bond between a former hostage and a former hostage-taker. Yeghiazarian, who is Golden Thread’s Founding Artistic Director, received the 2012 Gerbode-Hewlett Playwright Commission Award to write *Ellington’s Isfahan*, and is under commission by the Islamic Cultural Center of Northern California to write *The Fifth String: Ziryab’s Passage to Cordoba*, both slated to premiere in 2014.

Literary Artistic Associate **Evren Odcikin**, who will produce the production, says: “We’re thrilled to reintroduce Torange to our audiences as they first met her— a playwright. Torange writes with a deep affectionfor her characters and a deep understanding of the issues that divide and connect Iran and the U.S. I know that *444 Days* will have our audiences talking long after the play is done.”
