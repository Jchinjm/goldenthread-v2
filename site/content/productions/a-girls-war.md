  First produced at Boston Playwrights' Theatre in 2001, ***A Girl’s War*** was
  named one of the "top ten" plays of the year by the Boston Globe. A play about
  the impact of the Karabakh war on one family, it played to sold-out houses,
  winning the John Gassner Playwriting Award and the Provincetown Theatre
  Company Playwriting Award. In 2003, New Repertory Theatre produced the play,
  again to critical acclaim and sold-out houses. *A Girl’s War* was nominated in
  2003 for the prestigious American Theatre Critics Association Steinberg New
  Play Award, and published in the anthology *Contemporary Armenian American
  Drama* (Columbia Univ. Press, 2004). Joyce has since gone on to win
  commissions and playwriting fellowships from Ensemble Studio Theatre in New
  York, the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, and the MacDowell Colony. She
  is now working on a new play dealing with the intertwined lives of two women
  who come to America after the Armenian genocide.


  During a stormy fashion shoot, Anna Sarkisian, a New York fashion model, learns that her younger brother has been killed by enemy soldiers in her native Karabakh in the Caucasus Mountains. In the Armenian enclave of Karabakh, formerly part of the Soviet Union, an unresolved civil war still smolders between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The war has already killed Anna’s older brother and driven her mother into the army. Anna decides to return home to her village for the first time in 15 years. Living with her fiercely partisan Armenian mother in the bombed ruin of her childhood home, Anna defiantly refuses to identify herself with the Armenian cause. Tensions ignite when, Ilyas, a young Azeri deserter shows up, claiming to be a former neighbor. Anna and Ilyas, powerfully drawn to one another, become lovers in secret. The competing desires of love and vengeance, fueled by jealousy, propel the characters toward an explosive climax with tragic consequences.
