          Narrative"
        text: >-
          **Sat, Nov 25, 4-6pm** | Potrero Stage (1695 18th Street, San
          Francisco)\

          For years — some might say centuries — America’s narratives have focused on the experience of white bodies as told through the eyes of the colonizer, framing the place of brown bodies in the process. What happens when we reorient our perspective? How do we shift the reference point away from a white narrative? How do we negotiate differences of experience and perspective within marginalized communities? Whose stories are told on American stages and from what lens? *(Presented in association with USF)*\

          **Chair and Moderator:** Roberto Gutiérrez Varea\

          **Panelists:** Eugenie Chan, Edris Cooper-Anifowoshe, Philip Kan Gotanda, Lauren Spencer, Eric Ting, and Torange Yeghiazarian\

          What is it like to stage a Middle Eastern story in today’s climate? How do dramaturgs provide truthful context, provoke meaningful conversation, help collaborators make choices with integrity, and ensure cultural competency? Can dramaturgy affect the way we perceive and communicate about the Middle East? Does dramaturgy change our perspectives?\

          Meet Bay Area dramaturgs, directors, and ReOrient artists who take us behind-the-scenes of their processes to share and discuss personal experiences with Middle Eastern playwrights and plays, both inside and beyond the first-time partnership between Golden Thread and LMDA. Master dramaturg and director Jayne Wenger will lead us in a roundtable discussion that helps us forge ahead toward the growth and prosperity of Middle Eastern American theatre. *(Presented in association with LMDA)*\

This year’s ReOrient Festival marks our first collaboration with the **[Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas (LMDA)](lmda.org)**. The partnership brings together two organizations that value challenging cultural preconceptions through provocative programming and dialogue. Curated by LMDA’s Regional VP of Metro Bay Area Nakissa Etemad, LMDA is providing a team of production dramaturgs to collaborate on the plays in script development and research, and publications dramaturgs to write feature articles that take you behind-the-scenes of ReOrient, which you will be able to read here.
