heading: An Armenian-American family’s journey towards accepting the past and
  embracing the future.
description: "*Nine Armenians* is the story of three generations of
  Armenian-Americans embracing the future by connecting with their history. In
  this award-winning play, Leslie Ayvazian has beautifully depicted the reality
  of facing a horrific past without shame or fear. The Armenian Genocide is a
  particularly sensitive subject, as the Turkish government has never
  acknowledged it.The playwright takes a risk by shedding light on the painful
  recollections of the past.But isn’t this validation the only way to reach
  understanding and restore faith in the future?"

The grand parents in the play are survivors of the Armenian genocide who never taught their children how to speak Armenian because they wanted them to be real Americans. But now, as the grandfather is facing his own mortality, he feels an urgency to impart the truth to the next generation. His death in the first scene is the impetus for the eldest daughter to travel to Armenia for the first time. She must see with her own eyes what she has only been told about all her life.
