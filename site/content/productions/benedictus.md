description: >-
  Two childhood friends, one Jewish and one Muslim, find themselves estranged
  and on opposing sides after the 1979 Revolution. Propelled by world events and
  against a backdrop of an imminent US invasion of Iran , they agree to a secret
  meeting in a Benedictine monastery in Rome to negotiate a price for safety and
  freedom.


  *Benedictus* explores how the relationship among Iran, Israel, and United States is impacting the world. The work began in the summer of 2005 as the *Iran/Israel/US Project*, with a two-week residency at Siena College in upstate New York and has continued over the past two years. Given the impossibility of meeting in Iran and the complexities of meeting in Israel, these artists are working in the US to create collaborative theatre in the midst of escalating political conflict amongst their home countries. The piece created offers an opportunity to engage non-violently and creatively with the historical, social, religious and aesthetic dimensions of this crucial inter-relationship. 


  After its world premiere in San Francisco, this production of *Benedictus* will be remounted at The Los Angeles Theater Center, Jose Luis Valenzuela artistic director.
