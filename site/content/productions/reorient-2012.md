        text: Meet Politica, a vivacious woman, who must choose between her domineering
          husband War and oft-disappointing lover Peace. Funny and subtle, this
          symbolic play by Egypt’s foremost playwright could keep a senior
          seminar in a political science department busy for weeks.

          about the Iraqi War. El Guindi, the 2011 winner of the prestigious

          In 2011, Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Tony Kushner was blocked
          from receiving an honorary degree from CUNY for his criticism of
          Israel. Palestinian-American physicist Kamal and his philosopher
          daughter Alia take their outrage to the stage, but, first, can they
          really prove that they are human?

          At a hi-fi shop and a disco in London and a war field in Iraq, the
          inherent racism and sexism of the bravura male culture is brilliantly

          Israeli soldier Orh follows Lebanese poet Iman to the United States
          mesmerized by the haunting beauty of her poetry. Can their mutual love
