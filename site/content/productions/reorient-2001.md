        subtitle: "***Stoning*** by Ghazi Rabihavi, directed by Hal Gelb"
        text: Harold Pinter who produced Rabihavi’s debut in London’s Almieda Theatre
          described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of work,

          presents the story of a woman accused of adultery. Through a series of
          20 vignettes, Rabihavi masterfully reveals the inner workings of human
          emotions caught in an authoritarian regime where even one’s own flesh
          and blood cannot be trusted. Directed by Hal Gelb whose direction last
          June of Karim Alrawi’s *Deep Cut* was described as ‘Brilliant’ and
          ‘Flawless.’

          picture of the international crossroads that is Cairo where a Nigerian
          prostitute and an American expatriate exchange skeletons from their
          respective closets.
