          it adultery?*


          **Ghazi Rabihavi** (Playwright)- Since migrating to the U.K. from Iran where most of his writing is banned from publication, Ghazi has had a number of novels, short stories and plays published and produced in Europe. In 1997, Harold Pinter introduced Ghazi to the British public by producing his play *Look Europe!* at Almeida Theatre in London. Pinter called *Look Europe!* “A work of a gifted writer” and later described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of work, beautifully constructed.” In addition to productions in London and Amsterdam *Look Europe!* has also been staged in New York at the Actors’ Studio. This is the world premier of *Stoning*. Ghazi is currently working on his new play, *Captured by Camera*, which will be performed in October in London and Amsterdam. It is based on a true story of Ahmad Batebi, an Iranian film student who is serving 15 years in prison for being photographed by a journalist during the recent student demonstrations in Tehran. *Captured by Camera* and *Look* *Europe!* are both written in support of the prisoners of conscious in Iran.

          Chekhov's classic comedy naturally lends itself to an Arab-American
          setting. The hapless suitor gets much more than he bargained for in
          the woman he perceives to be the perfect Arab wife.

His last poem, *Crossing Borders*, was published on placards and placed on buses as part of Seattle’s Poetry and Art on Buses. Yussef’s short film *Love Stalks* won an award for best short narrative film at Seattle Underground Film Festival and was aired on KTEH. A native of Egypt, Yussef holds an M.F.A in Playwriting from Carnegie-Mellon University and was playwright in-residence at Duke University.

        subtitle: by Ghazi Rabihavi, directed by Hal Gelb
        text: >-
          Harold Pinter who produced Rabihavi’s debut in London’s Almieda
          Theatre described *Stoning* as “A very strong and powerful piece of
          work, beautifully constructed.” Set during the Iran-Iraq war,
          *Stoning* presents the story of a woman accused of adultery. Through a
          series of 20 vignettes, Rabihavi masterfully reveals the inner
          workings of human emotions caught in an authoritarian regime where
          even one’s own flesh and blood cannot be trusted. Directed by Hal Gelb
          whose direction last June of Karim Alrawi’s *Deep Cut* was described
          as ‘Brilliant’ and ‘Flawless.’
