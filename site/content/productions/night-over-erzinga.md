heading: An Armenian Family’s Story of Survival and Reconciliation
description: Ardavazt and Alice build a new life in the U.S. in the aftermath of
  the Armenian Genocide but the past comes to haunt them in very different ways.
  Inspired by the playwright's family history, this tender epic spans
  generations and countries in a fluid and magical narrative that will be scored
  with original music by Bulgarian composer, Penka Kouneva; directed by
  international artist, Hafiz Karmali, set design by award-winning Mikiko
  Uesugi. "How did my grandfather lose two families in one lifetime but not lose
  his heart?" was the question that began Adriana's two-year journey to develop
  Night Over Erzinga, the inaugural commission of the prestigious Middle East
  America Award.

      bio: "After pursuing his MFA (in Directing) at Carnegie-Mellon University School
        of Drama, **Hafiz Karmali** served an apprenticeship at the American
        Repertory Theatre where he assisted internationally renowned directors
        Robert Wilson and Andrei Serban. While at the A.R.T, Mr. Karmali was a
        teaching fellow in the English Department at Harvard University for
        courses taught by Professor Robert Brustein. Hafiz has a special
        interest in cross-cultural performances with a view to showcasing
        indigenous performing arts of the Islamic world. With theatre
        productions of esoteric/mystical fables such as Attar’s CONFERENCE OF
        THE BIRDS (Ismaili Centre, London) Hafiz seeks to promote a better
        understanding of the arts and ideas of the Muslim world. Golden Thread
        audiences may be familiar with Hafiz Karmali’s work: three new plays at
        the ReOrient Festival in 2009: ABAGA by Torange Yeghiazarian; A MARRIAGE
        PROPOSAL (Egyptian Chekhov) and THE REVIEW (via “skype”) both by Yussef
        El-Guindi; as well as in 2006, the Ikhwan al-Safa’s fable ISLAND OF
        ANIMALS. More recently, to commemorate Prince Karim Aga Khan’s golden
        jubilee (50th Anniversary) as spiritual leader, Hafiz co-wrote and
        directed ALI TO KARIM – A Tribute to the Ismaili Imams, an international
        touring theatre production. Hafiz is currently preparing his next show
        for Golden Thread Productions: RUMI x 7 = Tales from the Masnavi to be
        staged at the Islamic Cultural Centre in Oakland as part of a special
        series, ISLAM 101 – A Basic Guide."

      name: Natalie Amanian
      bio: "**Natalie Amanian,** born in October 2002, is a 4th-grade student at KZV
        Armenian School where she studies English and Armenian Language, history
        and social studies. How can we forget her favorite subject, Math? She
        also belongs to tennis, basketball and Armenian Scouts (Homenetmen)
        clubs. Natalie is very happy to make her theatrical debut with Golden
        Thread Productions and has this to say about NIGHT OVER ERZINGA, \"I am
        the first American-Armenian in my family. I am confused about what
        happened to Armenians in 1915. My grandfather told me that my great
        grandfather and his 6 year old brother were the only survivors in his
        family; they were rescued by a Turkish family then sent to an orphanage
        in Syria. I can relate to my Grandfather in NIGHT OVER ERZINGA, as he
        could have been one of my great grandfathers leaving his family behind,
        without knowing what actually happened to them. Each Armenian's journey
        may have been different but the cause was the same. The only way we can
        preserve our heritage is by never forgetting where we actually come
        from.\""

NIGHT OVER ERZINGA, written by award winning playwright, Adriana Sevahn Nichols, tells the moving story of an immigrant family of Armenian and Dominican heritage, exploring how a man can lose everything but his heart, and how a grandmother can reach through time, to unearth the untold story, and bring her children "home." Spanning two continents and three generations, from Western Armenia of 1913, to 1930's Massachusetts, to 1960's New York, ancestors are reunited with the living, as they each search for solace, and a way to make peace with the past.
