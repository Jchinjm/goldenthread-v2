Will Nasrudin and his faithful donkey ever make it to Samarkand, the center of arts and crafts on the ancient Silk Road? There is only one way to find out! This visually colorful performance with dynamic story-telling, dance and music is adapted from several folk tales centered around the comedic personage, Nasrudin Hoja, a wise fool renowned in Central Asia, Turkey and Iran.
