  Golden Thread Productions' Festival of One-Acts will present six short works
  by authors from, or on themes concerning, the Middle East. Most of the
  productions will be premieres of original plays developed by the company,
  however, Bay Area theatre lovers will recognize Emily Shihadeh’s *Grapes and
  Figs are in Season* which has previously toured the Bay Area to remarkable
  reviews. 


  This unusual festival, perhaps the first of its kind in the US, will run in repertory for four weeks in August at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco. Golden Thread Productions, which defines its connection to the Middle East expansively and inclusively, is made up of artists from all parts of the globe.

        title: Grapes And Figs Are In Season, A Palestinian Woman’s Story
        subtitle: Written by Emily Shihadeh with Victoria Rue
        text: This is the story of Emily Shihadeh, a Palestinian woman who at the age of
          seventeen immigrates to the United States of America to join her
          husband in San Francisco. ‘A friend, told me as I shared with him my
          life in America, “You came to a country populated by your mother.” How
          true that statement was! So many were so busy, they ignored me and
          were unable to express any feelings of warmth to me. That was just
          like my mother! I wanted to tell the people of this country about my
          people and their beauty and struggle. The devastation that happened in
          Palestine is known to very few. Through my personal stories I open a
          glimpse into life in Palestine.’ Through a series of short letters
          addressed to her mother, the audience will share some of the
          challenges Emily faced coming to a new country trying to understand
          the people and their rules.
