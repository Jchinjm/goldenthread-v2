  Golden Thread Productions' Festival of One-Acts will present six short works
  by authors from, or on themes concerning, the Middle East. Most of the
  productions will be premieres of original plays developed by the company,
  however, Bay Area theatre lovers will recognize Emily Shihadeh’s *Grapes and
  Figs are in Season* which has previously toured the Bay Area to remarkable
  reviews. 


  This unusual festival, perhaps the first of its kind in the US, will run in repertory for four weeks in August at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco. Golden Thread Productions, which defines its connection to the Middle East expansively and inclusively, is made up of artists from all parts of the globe.

        title: Rimm, the Gazelle
        text: >-
          *Rimm, la gazelle* was first performed in December 1992 at the Théâtre
          de la Tête Noire in Saran, France by Compagnie Trait pour Trait
          D'Orléans. It was reprised at the Festival Avignon-off in July, 1993,
          with Franςoise Tixier in the title role. Copyright (c) 1993 by
          Éditións des Quatre-Vents. Used by courtesy of the author.


          *Rimm, the Gazelle* is part of an unofficial quasi-autobiographical trilogy by Fatima Gallaire that includes another one-woman one-act, A Burn on the Heart, and also Gallaire’s most famous full-length tragedy, Princesses. In sum, the three plays pay tribute to her family and explore the process

          of dislocation through time and space that accompanies migration. Rimm is going home to Algeria after living for years in France, but can home ever be the place one expects it to be?

          There is more repetition in our lives than we would like to admit. We
          crave it, count on it, hope for it. When it comes to matters of the
          heart, we all hope to meet the “right person” in one of our
          repetitious cycles. And when we do… then what?


          Caveh Zahedi is an independent filmmaker of Iranian descent. His most recent feature, I Don't Hate Las Vegas Anymore, won the critics prize at the Rotterdam Film Festival. With Greg Watkins, he also co-wrote, co-directed, and acted in *A Little Stiff*.

        title: Grapes And Figs Are In Season, A Palestinian Woman’s Story
        subtitle: Written by Emily Shihadeh with Victoria Rue
        text: This is the story of Emily Shihadeh, a Palestinian woman who at the age of
          seventeen immigrates to the United States of America to join her
          husband in San Francisco. ‘A friend, told me as I shared with him my
          life in America, “You came to a country populated by your mother.” How
          true that statement was! So many were so busy, they ignored me and
          were unable to express any feelings of warmth to me. That was just
          like my mother! I wanted to tell the people of this country about my
          people and their beauty and struggle. The devastation that happened in
          Palestine is known to very few. Through my personal stories I open a
          glimpse into life in Palestine.’ Through a series of short letters
          addressed to her mother, the audience will share some of the
          challenges Emily faced coming to a new country trying to understand
          the people and their rules.
