description: Ahmed is a shining example of the American Dream, working as a
  translator in a Homeland Security detainment facility. His friend Nasser, the
  only other Muslim on the compound, soon brings him some bad news—that his
  loyalties are being called into question. As office politics take a turn for
  the absurd all around him, Ahmed realizes that much more than just his job
  hangs in the balance.

Yussef El Guindi (*Back of the Throat* and *Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov Babes*) returns to Golden Thread with this unexpected juxtaposition of a comical political thriller and an American immigrant family story. El Guindi, who has long been a Golden Thread favorite, has recently received national accolades, including the 2011 Middle East America Award and the 2012 Harold and Mimi Steinberg/American Theatre Critics Association New Play Award.

Language Rooms was originally developed at ACT Theatre, Seattle, WA and Playwrights Foundation In the Rough series, San Francisco, CA. Further developed by New York Stage and Film Company and the Powerhouse Theater in a reading at Vassar on June 29, 2009. The world premiere of Language Rooms was produced by The Wilma Theater. Golden Thread will remount this production at the Los Angeles Theater Center in 2012.
