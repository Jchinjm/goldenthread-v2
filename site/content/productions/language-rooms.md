description: Ahmed is a shining example of the American Dream, working as a
  translator in a Homeland Security detainment facility. His friend Nasser, the
  only other Muslim on the compound, soon brings him some bad news—that his
  loyalties are being called into question. As office politics take a turn for
  the absurd all around him, Ahmed realizes that much more than just his job
  hangs in the balance.
