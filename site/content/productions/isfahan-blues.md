description: Inspired by Duke Ellington Orchestra’s 1963 tour to Iran, *Isfahan
  Blues* imagines an unlikely friendship between an American jazz musician and
  an Iranian actress. As they travel together to Isfahan, “the most beautiful
  city in the world,” Jazz inspires them to test the limits of freedom,
  creativity, and experimentation. Contrary to today’s political stalemate
  between the US and Iran, this production aims to shed light on a little-known
  historical moment when a uniquely American art form inspired generations of
  young Iranian musicians.
