          “**A multi-layered, intellectually complex, and splendid piece of
          work**… Under Odcikin’s deft (and often breathless) direction, Golden
          Thread’s ensemble of five determined artists jumps through acting
          hoops that range from hilariously fake attempts at empathy to
          painfully honest confessions; from surprisingly agile bits of physical
          comedy to heartbreaking moments of personal cruelty.”\

          “The show is often very funny, especially in the many uncomfortable
          moments between the performers. Just as often, it’s disturbing in how
          aptly it captures how thin people’s veneer of tolerance can be, even —
          or rather especially — when they believe it to be genuine.”\

          “Relax everybody —*Autobiography* is a comedy! No bombs or blood. Just
          a provocative (and amusing) account of what it meant to be a
          ‘hyphenated American’.”\

          —*Pacific Sun*
      - text: >-
          “Throughout *Autobiography*, there’s a running joke about people
          mispronouncing \[Said’s last name]: “Stirfryday” is the funniest
          example. The play repeats this seemingly unimportant point to make a
          larger one. A certain American demographic remains indifferent and
          wary of other cultures and other languages. For those who can’t pass
          as a Smith or Jones, Sayrafiezadeh also points out that the rah-rah
          jingoism of a USA chant always carries a belligerent edge.”\

Saïd has written a play about growing up Iranian and Jewish-American during the Iran hostage crisis. As he and his well-meaning collaborators try to stage his script, things go quickly and hilariously from bad to worse. Will Saïd ever be able to just fit in? Whiting Award–winning writer Sayrafiezadeh (*Brief Encounters With the Enemy*,*When Skateboards Will Be Free*) brilliantly pokes fun at the complications of hyphenated identity in America.
