  Adapted from The Doll Behind the Curtain by Sadegh Hedayat


  The overpowering presence of self-inflicted exile dominates Hedayat's writing. The protagonist in The Doll Behind the Curtain, much like Hedayat himself feels isolated from his society. The protagonist reacts by creating an alternative reality. The universality of this theme, and its resonance to current times with thousands of Iranians living abroad make the stage adaptation of the play particularly timely.

Behrooz, an Iranian young man raised in the United States must now settle down. Will he choose the comforts of tradition or the excitement of the new? Overpowered by the demands surrounding him, Behrooz creates an alternative reality, one in which a man can have a perfectly normal and emotionally satisfying relationship with a mannequin.
