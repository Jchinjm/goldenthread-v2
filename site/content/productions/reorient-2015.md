      - title: "Keynote Address: Sunaina Maira"
        pre: "Youth, Activism, and Arts: Cultures of Protest/Protesting Culture"
        subtitle: >-
          Saturday, Oct 3, 2015\

          9:15am–10:00am


          Art is an important medium of protest in the Middle East and across the world. How can artistic expression challenge the dominant assumptions about Muslim and Middle Eastern youth and communities in the US? What does it mean for protest culture to also protest cultural norms and hierarchies—of race, religion, class, gender, and sexuality? Maira will draw on her research on Palestinian, Afghan, and South Asian American youth culture and activism. The talk will be followed by a dialogue with the audience.
        text: "**Sunaina Maira** is Professor of Asian American Studies at the
          University of California, Davis. Her research and teaching focus on
          Asian and Arab American youth, citizenship, and popular culture. She
          is the author of *Desis in the House: Indian American Youth Culture in
          New York City* and co-editor of books including *Contours of the
          Heart: South Asians Map North America*, which won the American Book
          Award. Her recent publications include the book, *Missing: Youth,
          Citizenship, and Empire After 9/11*, and *Jil \\[Generation] Oslo:
          Palestinian Hip Hop, Youth Culture, and the Youth Movement*, based on
          ethnographic research in Palestine. Her new book project is a study of
          South Asian, Arab, and Afghan American youth in the Bay Area and
          post-9/11 activism focused on civil and human rights and issues of
          sovereignty and surveillance in the War on Terror."

        text: Our ability to engage in theatre collaborations across borders,
          particularly with artists living in the Middle East has been curtailed
          by lack of funding and politics. How can we create opportunities for
          collaboration among otherwise disconnected individuals that are
          cost-effective, manageable and have the potential to lead to long term
          relationships? Golden Thread’s *Project Alo?* teamed up 5 pairs of
          artists to engage in performative conversations using 1 minute video
          clips captured on their cell phones. The end result is video dialogues
          that are intimate, imaginative and reflect the need for connection.

          Cultural Restoration"
        subtitle: >-
          Saturday, Oct 3, 2015\

          11:30am - 12:45pm


          Sponsor: University of San Francisco, Performing Arts & Social Justice Program\

          Chair: Roberto Varea (Associate Professor, Performing Arts & Social Justice, University of San Francisco)\

          Panelists: Claudia Bernardi (Artist, wallsofhope.org), L.M. Bogad (Author, Artist, Activist), Amie Dowling (Artist, Scholar, well contested sites), Philip Kan Gotanda (Playwright, Performer, Director)
        text: "In the midst or aftermath of social conflict, or while enduring ongoing
          structural violence, the task of restoring the torn social fabric of
          affected communities and sustaining oppressed identities is formidable
          and relentless. Artists and cultural workers often play a central role
          in sustaining identity –and humanity, through their creative work.
          This panel asks: how does performance (or art) contribute to accessing
          cultural memory, sustaining resistance practices and, if possible,
          facilitating reconciliation processes? What can the creative
          imagination unlock that may make breakthroughs possible? Is it
          possible to engage “the other” through a performance work that may
          reveal a common humanity?"

        text: Iranian theatre artists have been active outside Iran since the 1960s.
          Responding to revolutions, coups, and various forms of political
          pressure, they have created performances that reflect an evolving
          national identity outside Iran’s geographic borders. What is the
          impetus for creating “Iranian theatre” outside Iran and how has the
          process changed through the decades? Four generations of Iranian
          theatre directors and playwrights will discuss their hopes and
          challenges in producing plays from and about Iran on North American
          stages.

        text: "It can often feel like one has to choose between queerness or ethnicity.
          So called feminist, queer and trans* communities can feel whitewashed,
          and yet our ethnic communities and families can feel rigid,
          misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, and conservative. Still, there
          are many of us who inhabit a multitude of intersecting
          identities—refusing to make a choice and standing firm in our
          understanding that “either/or” reduces the nuances and complexities of
          our ethnic communities and our struggles for survival in the face of
          ongoing imperialism, displacement, and trauma. And so, we must contend
          with the inevitable questions: In what ways do we (re)claim queerness
          as brown and ethnic? In what ways do we (re)claim our ethnicities and
          religions as queer? And, what role does art play in these acts of
          reclamation? This panel explores what living at the intersections
          looks like, along with the masks, cultural myths, false dichotomies,
          in-between states, and shape-shifting that makes movement between
          multiple worlds possible. This is also and ultimately a conversation
          about how art and performance can act as a bridge between inherently
          linked but seemingly opposing experiences and identities."

          This performance and discussion forum on new Palestinian drama will
          bring together six playwrights from Palestine and the Diaspora,
          including a writer living and working in the occupied West Bank, a
          Palestinian citizen of Israel, two Palestinian refugees who grew up in
          Syria and are now living in Turkey and Spain, and two dramatists of
          Palestinian descent writing in English in the U.S. and U.K. While the
          theme of identity and belonging tends to dominate plays written in
          English for Western audiences, issues of oppression, poverty, and
          corruption often stand at the center of works created within Palestine
          and the Arab World. Despite stark differences between them, how might
          these plays and writers join in solidarity with one another
          politically or aesthetically? This forum will offer a glimpse into
          exciting new works and a provocative and candid conversation on
          contemporary Palestinian theatre.


          This panel will conclude with the exclusive launch of ***Inside/Outside: Six Plays from Palestine and the Diaspora***, a new anthology edited by Naomi Wallace and Ismail Khalidi, that brings together work by six dynamic Palestinian playwrights from both occupied Palestine and the Diaspora.


          This panel was made possible by generous funding from the **Doris Duke Foundation’s Building Bridges Program**.

        text: The landscape of culturally-specific theatre in the Bay Area has shifted
          dramatically. National models such as the Traveling Jewish Theatre
          have closed. Longstanding organizations such as the Asian-American
          Theater Company and the Lorraine Hansberry have been quiet. How will
          culturally-specific voices be represented? Are the days of hyphenated
          theatre over? As we move towards an ever more multifaceted population,
          are artists and audiences reluctant to align themselves with one
          cultural identity alone? This session will be conducted in a
          highly-interactive “fishbowl” format.
