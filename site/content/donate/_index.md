As the world around us changes, Golden Thread’s commitment to bring you stories from and about the Middle East remains constant. For 25 years, we have been making theatre that broadens perceptions of the Middle East in the US from narrow stereotypes to multi-layered portrayals that reflect its true complexity and rich diversity. 

Our work is far from done. As Muslims, immigrants, and “minorities”, Middle Easterners in the US are often targeted, harassed and vilified. In addition, Middle Eastern voices are rarely included in US culture, especially in the mainstream American theatre.
	
With high-quality artistic programming, a community based approach, and a legacy of inclusion on the American stage, all focused on the Middle East, we are unique among Bay Area theatres. At Golden Thread, celebrating the plurality of Middle East identities and perspectives is an invitation for all of us to find meaningful reflection in someone else’s story, a great necessity, especially in times of profound divisiveness.

Your continued support is essential as we adapt to the many challenges ahead. Make your contribution today!
