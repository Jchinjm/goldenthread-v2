### **Executive Artistic Director**

SUMMARY OF OPPORTUNITY – Golden Thread Productions is seeking a new Executive Artistic Director (EAD) to follow in the footsteps of Founding Artistic Director Torange Yeghiazarian. This is a full-time position in San Francisco, CA. The EAD leads a professional staff of 5 and reports to the Board of Trustees. The EAD is responsible for implementing Golden Thread’s mission through compelling artistic programming, visionary strategic planning and sound operational management. The ideal candidate would be an experienced theatre producer and inspiring artistic leader with exceptional understanding of Middle Eastern and Middle Eastern American theatre as well as lived understanding of the diverse communities that shape it.

BACKGROUND – Founded in 1996, Golden Thread Productions is the first American theatre company devoted to plays from or about the Middle East, defined broadly and inclusively. Golden Thread’s mission is to produce passionate and provocative plays from or about the Middle East – including its global diaspora - that celebrate the multiplicity of its perspectives and identities. We are a developmental catalyst and vibrant artistic home to artists at various stages of their career. We bring the Middle East to the American stage, creating treasured cultural experiences for audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

For more than two decades, Golden Thread Productions has been expanding the scope of mainstream American storytelling to include Middle Eastern immigrant perspectives, and advocating for diversity and inclusion in the American theatre nationally. Facilitating conversations and cultural bridge-building among artists, audiences, and diverse communities is at the core of our artistic practice. With more than half of our audience made up of individuals not of Middle Eastern heritage, many seek out Golden Thread in search of alternative perspectives of the Middle East and to learn about cultures different than their own. 

Golden Thread’s signature programs include ReOrient Festival of short plays; development and production of full-length plays; New Threads staged reading series; What do the Women Say? a curated evening highlighting Middle East women artists, and Golden Thread Fairytale Players creation and touring of plays based on Middle Eastern folktales and traditions. 

For the past five years, Golden Thread has enjoyed steady growth expanding from $213K budget in 2013 to $500K in 2019, through significant investment in staff and board development and community engagement \[prospect cultivation].
