### **Executive Artistic Director**

SUMMARY OF OPPORTUNITY: Golden Thread Productions is seeking a new Executive Artistic Director (EAD) to follow in the footsteps of Founding Artistic Director Torange Yeghiazarian.

The EAD is responsible for implementing Golden Thread’s mission through compelling artistic programming, visionary strategic planning and sound operational management.
