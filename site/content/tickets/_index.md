      - title: "Golden Classics: Nine Armenians"
        pre: Vintage Videos From Golden Thread’s Vault
        subtitle: >-
          Nine Armenians by Leslie Ayvazian, directed by Torange Yeghiazarian.


          Winner of Roger L. Stevens and the Susan Smith Blackburn Award.


          An Armenian-American family's journey towards accepting the past and embracing the future.
        text: >-
          Nine Armenians is the story of three generations of Armenian-Americans
          embracing the future by connecting with their history. Made possible
          by tremendous support from the Bay Area’s Armenian community, Golden
          Thread’s production was originally staged at the Magic Theater in
          2002.


          In this award-wining play, Leslie Ayvazian has beautifully depicted the reality of facing a horrific past without shame or fear. The grand parents in the play are survivors of the Armenian Genocide who never taught their children how to speak Armenian because they wanted them to be real Americans. But now, as the grand father is facing his own mortality, he feels an urgency to impart the truth to the next generation. His death in the first scene is the impetus for the eldest daughter to travel to Armenia for the first time. She must see with her own eyes what she has only been told about all her life.


          **Featuring:** Atosa Babaoff*, Toby Brooks, Valerie de Jose*, Vida Ghahremani, Behzad Golemohammadi, Joe Higgins*, Earll Kingston*, Lara Palanjian, Ruby Unger\*
