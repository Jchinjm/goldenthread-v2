**Our Global Community: Reaching professional theatre artists in the Middle East**

*The Review*\
Internet Play Performance & Talkback with Yussef El Guindi in Cairo

For years, limited resources have hindered our ability to bring theatre artists from the Middle East to San Francisco. But now, thanks to the Internet and advances in video-conferencing technology, we are able to reach our colleagues in the Middle East on line. We will visit theatre artists in their work studio, perform an online play, and conduct Q&A with a playwright…over the Internet. Barring a global technological disaster, it should all work very smoothly!



2:30pm – Panel Discussion\
**Permission to Represent & Transform: New Play Development in the Age of Identity Politics**\
Participants: Motti Lerner (playwright), Denmo Ibrahim & Evren Odcikin (playwright & director), Adriana Sevahn Nichols (playwright)

Artists, particularly those from minority groups, often struggle with the responsibility of ‘representing’ their community. Driven by the urge to investigate their roots through developing a new play, three artists discuss their personal journey of reconnecting with their heritage, and redefining it in the process. Pioneering Asian-American playwright, Philip Gotanda, leads the conversation with Egyptian-American Denmo Ibrahim and Turkish-American Evren Odcikin, the creative team behind Ecstasy | a waterfable; and Armenian-Dominican-American Adriana Sevahn Nichols, Middle East America’s Distinguished Playwright, developing her new play Night Over Erzinga.



4:00pm - Concert *\
**ASWAT Bay Area Arab Music Ensemble**

ASWAT’s large ensemble of singers and musicians will perform classical and folk songs including favorites by Fairuz, Abdel Halim Hafiz, Abdel Wahab, Um Kulthum, as well as Muwashshah hat, a seldom performed music from Andalucía. The program features soloists: Yasmeen Daifallah, Rana Mroue, and Husain Resan. The ensemble plays traditional musical instruments such as the qanun (trapezoidal zither), ‘ud (lute), nay (reed flute), Kaman (violin), riqq/daff (tambourine), tar and darbukkah/tablah (goblet drum).

Established in the year 2000, ASWAT is dedicated to preserving, promoting and presenting Arab American’s cultural heritage through music and art. ASWAT trains both Arab and American musicians and singers in folkloric, classical, and contemporary Arabic music

Participants: Catherine Filloux (Playwright, Theatre Without Borders), Motti Lerner (Playwright), Hafiz Karmali (Director)

Much has been made of the Arts, particularly theatre and cinema, in the service of the Empire. But what of theatre’s ability to build bridges and resolve conflicts? Argentinean director, Roberto Varea, Chair of University of San Francisco’s Performance & Social Justice Program, engages three international theatre artists who have devoted their careers to collaborating with marginalized communities and creating safe spaces for countering dominant narratives, as well as preserving histories that are at risk of extinction.

*The Review*\
Internet Play Performance & Talkback with Yussef El Guindi in Cairo

For the first time in ReOrient history, a play will be performed live via the Internet with one character in San Francisco and the other in the Middle East. Written especially for this occasion, *The Review*, is a comedy of self-deprecation and painful co-dependency. Another gem from the writer of *Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov Babes*!

**Intercultural Artistic Exchange: Obstacles & Opportunities**\
Participants: Lisa Schlesinger (Playwright), Iman Aoun (Playwright), Hyesun Shin
