description: We are thrilled to launch NO SUMMARY, our new Live-Stream Series of
  artists in conversation with our artistic director Torange Yeghiazarian. These
  curated digital discussions will invite artists of Middle Eastern and North
  African heritage to discuss the many layers of their identity and how it
  impacts their work and artistic choices. We invite you to take pause with us
  and immerse yourself in these compelling topics and histories that defy a
  snappy summation. See below for a preview schedule of our first three
  episodes!

**Featuring leading Iranian playwright, Naghmeh Samini**

*NO SUMMARY* launches with a conversation with **Naghmeh Samini**, playwright of *The Language of Wild Berries,* which will be released as a radio play on October 6th. One of Iran’s leading playwrights, Samini’s work has been presented across Europe and Asia but she has never been produced in the US in English. At a time when US-Iran relations are at an all-time low, hearing directly from artists that create in both countries has never been more vital. The cast and creative team from the radio play will join the conversation.

**Featuring four singular playwrights of Arab heritage**

The series continues with a conversation with four playwrights of Arab heritage based in the US and the UK: **Hassan Abdulrazzak**, **Tariq Hamami**, **Hannah Khalil**, and **Mona Mansour**. We recently commissioned this extraordinary group to write new plays exploring vital themes and unique collaborations inspired by our current reality. Abdulrazzak, Khalil, and Mansour will develop a remote collaboration model to co-write a new play, and Hamami will write a play exploring the Black Panthers’ residency in Algeria in the 1960s and 70s.
