      worldwide to join. This year, our artist community came together to share
      this script in a multi-lingual tribute to the resilience and courage of
      theater artists.

      In an already complicated landscape of Middle Eastern identities, holding
      up our queerness can prove a challenge. Join us for our next episode

      these terrains, integrating them in their life and work. Immerse yourself
      in these compelling topics and histories that defy a snappy summation!
