      We are thrilled to commission four playwrights of Arab heritage to write
      new plays responding to the pandemic and the call for social justice. Join
      us in congratulating  **Hassan Abdulrazzak**, **Tariq Hamami**, **Hannah
      Khalil**, and **Mona Mansour**! Each playwright is sponsored by an
      individual community member and will share updates about the development
      of the work with their sponsor. This is yet another example of Golden
      Thread’s commitment to our artists and to engaging the community in the
      creative process.
